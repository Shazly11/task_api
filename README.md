## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- FastAPI
- SQLModel
- Uvicorn

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

To start the FastAPI application, run:

## Example API Call (cURL)

You can test the API by creating a sample task using this cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tasks" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "Sample Task", "priority": "high"}'
```

## Project Purpose

This system helps a CS graduate:

- Track self-learning tasks  
- Prepare for technical interviews  
- Manage progress in small projects  
- Stay organized and consistent
